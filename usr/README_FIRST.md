### GUIDefault (ModelName)

This option determines which `qMRLab` module will be shown in the method selection dropdown 
by default. For example: 

```json
"GUIDefault": {
		"Method": "vfa_t1"
	}
```

- MATLAB only 
- GUI only 

### FitParallelWheneverPossible (boolean)

Configures `qMRLab` to execute fitting using multiple CPU cores when the `Fit Data` button is
clicked in the GUI. 

```json
    "FitParallelWheneverPossible": true,
```

- MATLAB only
- Voxelwise models only (e.g. `inversion_recovery` or `qmt_spgr`)
- GUI only

For command-line (CLI) processes, please use `ParFitData` function. For details:

```
help ParFitData
```

### ParFitData (multiple)

Configures the default behaviour of `ParFitData` function.

```yml
"AutosaveEnabled": # [on 1, off 0, default 1] Save partial results when a batch is done processing or AutosaveInterval is reached 
"AutosaveInterval": #[min 1, default 5] If AutosaveEnabled is set to 1, determines the period at which outputs will be saved. Each CPU worker times its own process.
"Granularity": # [min 2, max 5, default 3] Determines how many data chunks will be created to parallelize the fitting. nChunks = nCores X Granularity.
"RemoveTmpOnSuccess": # [on 1, off 0, default 1] Determines whether to remove ParFitTempResults* folder after the execution finished.
```
- MATLAB only
- Voxelwise only 
- GUI & CLI 

For details:

```
help ParFitData
```

### ForAllUnitsUseBIDS (boolean)

If this setting is `true` then: 

1. Output maps will be generated in BIDS units (for example, `seconds` for relaxometry outputs, or `percent` for fraction maps)
2. Protocol values will be expected to be in BIDS units (for example,`seconds` for `RepetitionTime`)
3. If a method inputs a fieldmap or quantitative map, they are expected to follow BIDS units (for example, `relative percent` for B1+ maps)

Setting this to `true` will override `UnifyOutputMapUnits`, `UnifyInputProtocolUnits` and `ChangeProvidedInputMapUnits`. 

- Matlab/Octave 
- GUI & CLI 

### UnifyOutputMapUnits (multiple)

If `"Enabled": true`, then the units defined for each `unit family` will determine 
output units of the quantitative maps generated by qMRLab.

If you set `"Time": "millisecond",`, all the time-relevant output maps (e.g., `T1map`, `T2map`) will be saved
in milliseconds.

Currently available `unit families and accepted units are: 
- Time
    - `microsecond`
    - `millisecond`
    - `second`
    - `minute` 
    - `hour`
- Rate
    - `reciprocal_microsecond`
    - `reciprocal_millisecond`
    - `reciprocal_second`
- Fraction
    - `fraction_decimal` (from 0 to 1)
    - `fraction_percent` (from 0 to 100)
- B1
    - `relative_scaling_factor_decimal` (-inf, 1=ideal, +inf)
    - `relative_scaling_factor_percent` (-inf, 100=ideal, +inf)
- B0
    - `offset_factor_hertz` (-inf, 0Hz=ideal, +inf]
- Susceptibility
    - `part_per_million`
- Angle
    - `radian` 
    - `degree` 
- Diffusivity
    - `square_meter_per_second`
    - `square_micrometer_per_millisecond`
- Arbitrary
    - `arbitrary` (not scaled)
- Categorical
    - `categorical` (not scaled)
- Length 
    - `millimeter`
    - `micrometer`
- Tensor
    - `tensor` 

- Matlab/Octave 
- GUI & CLI

### UnifyInputProtocolUnits (multiple)

If `"Enabled": true`, then the units defined for each `unit family` will determine 
in which units are the inputs protocols expected.

If you set `"Time": "millisecond",`, all the time-relevant protocols (e.g., `T1map`, `T2map`) will be expected
in units. 

Activating this setting will change the protocol field labels in GUI and the units shown in demo scripts 
generated by `qMRGenBatch`.

For available units and unit familes, please see the list above. 

Overriden by `ForAllUnitsUseBIDS (true)` user setting or `setenv('ISBIDS','1')` environment variable. 

### UnifyInputProtocolUnits (multiple)

If `"Enabled": true`, then the units defined for each `unit family` will determine 
in which units are the input maps (e.g. `B1+map` or `R1map`) expected. 

If you set `"B1": "relative_scaling_factor_decimal"`, qMRLab will assume that the B1+ maps you provide 
are normalized such that `1` indicates (`actual` = `nominal` flip angle). Values smaller than `1` will
scale down the actual FA, and vice versa. 

For available units and unit familes, please see the list above. 

Overriden by `ForAllUnitsUseBIDS (true)` user setting or `setenv('ISBIDS','1')` environment variable. 

#### Note

qMRLab will use the units provided by original implementations when all the following settings are disabled: 
- `UnifyOutputMapUnits` 
- `UnifyInputProtocolUnits` 
- `ChangeProvidedInputMapUnits`
- `ForAllUnitsUseBIDS`

In this case, different models may operate in different units. For example, for `inversion_recovery` it is 
`milliseconds`, whereas for `vfa_t1` it is seconds. 

**Why different models may use different units when the unit selections are disabled?** 

qMRLab aims at collecting qMRI implementations from different labs under one umbrella. We keep the
implementations as close as possible to their original form and avoid enforcing a particular scaling.

This high-level configuration framework gives users the flexibility to work with units they prefer and keep implementations closer to they were originally developed.
